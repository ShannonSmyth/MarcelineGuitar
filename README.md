Code for an Arduino to play 8-bit music

Original tutorial found at https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/blackpanda856/play-music-using-arduino-uno-and-a-speaker-b94e4a
This tutorial played a single song as soon as the circuit was connected to power. I updated it to play the songs at the push of a button, and for there to be two different playable songs. Big thanks to the original poster, without them I wouldn't have had it done in time for Halloween :)
